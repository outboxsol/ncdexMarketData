In this test project EncodeDecodeTest.cs containing the code for
-Creating a sample fast template.
-Fill the template with the data, its encoding logic and decoding logic.

OpenFast project is the class library project that contains specification for the fast encoding.
In program.cs class i am trying to decode a byte array that i recieved from ncedx exchange if i am trying to decode it with ascii encoding it is giving this type of less meaningful data 
???20180212-06:38:37.65??1 ?????_ ???SYBEANIDR20FEB201?2856?? &> ???????? ???????????
since we need to parse this array using fast encoding specs.


NCEDX.xml is a fast template which i recieved from NCEDX team and loading it at the time of parsing the byte array data.
After loading template xml i am getting the array of the data of type MessageTemplate.
Now i tried to decode this with each Message template but not able to do the same getting some types of error.

One error occurring when this open fast dll is trying to obtain the Template identifier it is giving it 127 and then trying to retrieve the template from dictionary
since this template id does not exist it is throwing exception.

According to Fast Api document page no. 21

A template identifier is represented as an Unsigned Integer in the stream. It is a reportable error [ERR R6]
if it is overlong.
It is a dynamic error [ERR D9] if a decoder cannot find a template associated with a template identifier
appearing in the stream.


I bypass this error by doing a hardcode with the same id when template registration.

but string doing iteration with each template to parse the data i am not able to decode the message .
One thing i am suspecting that i might not have the correct template to parse the NCDEX broadcast data since OpenFast is calulating the template id is 127 and not able to find it or i am doing it with some wrong approach.


I have attached the test project with this mail.
